## Description
DiscreeTest, is a two-step evaluation metric for ranking discretization methods for time-series
data. The underlying assumption of DiscreeTest is that an optimal discretization method should
preserve the dynamic patterns observed in the original data across all variables. 

## Availability 
The source code of DiscreeTest is available in our Github repository: https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Benchmarking_TSDiscretizations
