# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Macrophages play prominent roles in bacteria recognition and clearance, including Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochete. To elucidate mechanisms by which MyD88/TLR signaling enhances clearance of Bb by macrophages, we studied Bb-infected wildtype (WT) and MyD88−/− mice and Bb-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Bb-infected MyD88−/− mice show increased bacterial burdens, macrophage infiltration and altered gene expression in inflamed heart tissue. MyD88−/− BMDMs exhibit impaired uptake of spirochetes but comparable maturation of phagosomes following internalization of spirochetes. RNA-sequencing of infected WT and MyD88−/− BMDMs identified a large cohort of differentially expressed MyD88-dependent genes involved in re-organization of actin and cytoskeleton during phagocytosis along with several MyD88-independent chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. We computationally generated networks which identified several MyD88-independent master regulators (Cxcl2 and Vcam1) and MyD88-dependent intermediate proteins (Rhoq and Cyfip1) that are known to mediate inflammation and phagocytosis respectively. These results provide mechanistic insights into MyD88-mediated phagosomal signaling enhancing Bb uptake and clearance."
