summary = "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a diverse group of cancers whose therapy relies on chemotherapy. Dr. Liu has identified a genomic configuration called the tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) that defines a major subgroup of TNBC (40%), with high sensitivity to cisplatin. Despite their initial responsiveness, the major hurdle to cure in TDP TNBC is the emergence of drug resistance. Using a patientderived xenograft (PDX) model of TDP TNBC and in vitro derivatives of these tumors, the objective of this project is to develop and validate a computational system biology pipeline for the construction and control of a core intracellular signaling network of resistance."

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a unique group of clinically aggressive breast cancers for which surgery and chemotherapy are the only available therapeutic modalities. Dr. Liu, co-investigator in this project and his lab, identified a genomic configuration called the tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) that defines a major subgroup of TNBC (40%). TDP tumors are initially highly sensitive to cisplatin. Despite their initial responsiveness, they develop resistance to cisplatin therapy. The challenge addressed by the proposed project is to test and validate an analysis pipeline to identify therapeutic interventions to prevent or reverse cisplatin resistance in TNBC. The objective is to apply structure-based control approaches to identify network node overrides in the form of multiple gene interventions that have the effect of preventing the development of resistance. An important novel feature of this project is that the algorithms and their prediction will be validated with in vitro experiments using Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) tumors and tumor-derived primary cell in combination with multi-dimensional gene editing tool system.
