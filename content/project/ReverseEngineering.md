Much of our research work is related to the development and application of algorithms related to the different undertakings for the reverse-engineering of dynamical systems, with an emphasis on discrete dynamical systems. These undertakings include: 

(1) Data discretization, 

(2) Static Network and Dynamical Model’s Inference, 

(3) Validation and Benchmarking of Reverse-engineering Algorithms,

(4) Model Analysis and Simulation.
