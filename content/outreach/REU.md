## Project Title
Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology

## Program Location 
Center for Quantitative Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, 263 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06032

## Program Background 
A 10-week, in-residence, intensive summer research program, focused on modeling and simulation in systems biology, for U.S. citizen or permanent resident undergraduate students from around the United States and Puerto Rico.  It will provide participants with a broad view of available career opportunities for mathematical scientists in academia, industry, and government.  Participants will have the opportunity to expand their professional network of peers and mentors.

## Vera-Licona's Research Group Involvement
For the period of 2015-2018, Dr. Vera-Licona was co-Principal Investigator in the program together with Dr. Laubenbacher.

Dr. Vera-Licona also has worked as mentor on the following projects:

#### Summer 2015 
Project Title: [Pipeline to Infer Brain Connectivity Networks from fMRI Data](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/117/2015/11/Poster_Updated.pdf). 

Students: Christopher Tseng (Emory University) and Shichao Wang (University of Pennsylvania).

#### Summer 2016 
Project Title: [Reverse Engineering Functional Brain Networks from fMRI Data Using Probabilistic Boolean Networks](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/117/2015/11/Poster2016-EBoggess-TJann.pdf).

Students: Erin Boggess (Simpson College) and Tiffany Jann (University of California, Berkeley).

#### Summer 2017 
Project Title: [Dynamic Connectivity in Neural Networks Engaged for Emotional Regulation](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/117/2017/10/KatherineT_Luke_Final-Poster.pdf) 
Students: Katherine Thai (Rutgers University) and Luke Wohlford (University of Arizona).
