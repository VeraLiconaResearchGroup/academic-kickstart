## Project Title
Big Genomic Data Skills Training for Professors (CT)

## Program Location 
The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT 06032

## ProgramÂ Background 
This program is funded by the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative. The purpose of the course is to offer training to professors from small colleges, regional universities, HBCU and INBRE institutions in big data-computational biology.  The goal of the program is to enable professors to launch Big Data or Computational Biology courses at their home institutions. Professors will be trained, receive a curricular model and be offered the ongoing technical support required to teach undergraduate courses in Biomedical Big Data science.  

## Vera-Licona's Research Group Involvement
Dr. Vera-Licona has participated yearly by introducing attendees to Network Modeling.
