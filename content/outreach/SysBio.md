## Course Number and Title
MEDS 6455: Introduction to Systems Biology

## Course Description 
The course will guide students into a biology world as seen by engineers, physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists. The goal is to provide the necessary background to read modeling papers, choose Systems Biology resources that will help in biological projects, and be able to select a modeling technique appropriate for a given biological project.


## Vera-Licona's Research Group Involvement
Dr. Vera-Licona introduces students to reverse engineering discrete dynamical systems.
