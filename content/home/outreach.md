Our research group is involved in several education and outreach activities and programs throughout the year. Here is a list of the current ones:

## Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
__Project Title__: Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology
Program Location: University of Connecticut Health Center, 263 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06032
__Program Background__: A 10-week, in-residence, intensive summer research program, focused on modeling and simulation in systems biology, for U.S. citizen or permanent resident undergraduate students from around the United States and Puerto Rico.  It will provide participants with a broad view of available career opportunities for mathematical scientists in academia, industry, and government.  Participants will have the opportunity to expand their professional network of peers and mentors.

## Summer Research Fellowship Program
This is a yearly summer research experiences for undergraduates run by the Department of Health Career Opportunity Programs at UConn Health through the Aetna Health Professions Partnership Initiative (Aetna HPPI). We will merge the REU activities with those of the Department of Health Career Opportunity’s Summer Research Fellowship Program, a 10-week research enrichment experience for college juniors, seniors and recent graduates. Every summer, we will receive one student from this program and incorporate her/him into the research and career development activities we coordinate through the REU program.

## Junior  & Senior Doctors Academy Program
Outreach activities with 11th and 12th grade students through the Department of Health Career Opportunity Programs at UConn Health.  This is a program for 11th and 12th graders comprised of classes (e.g. Math and Science) and enrichment courses that include independent projects in STEM, enrichment trips and guidance in career objectives and goals. We will deliver seminars for the participant students, designed to expose them to the many possibilities on STEM career paths and how they contribute to society, including life sciences and medicine.
