# About Us

The Computational Systems Medicine research group works on a variety of problems within the fields of computational systems medicine, computational systems biology, mathematical biology and bioinformatics. The core of the research is on the design and software development of mathematical algorithms for the modeling, simulation and control of biological networks such as gene regulatory networks, intra-cellular signaling networks and functional brain networks. While the mathematical and computational tools employed are varied, many of the approaches developed have a flavor of fields such as discrete mathematics (graph theory and combinatorics), algebra, computational algebra as well as machine learning and network science.
