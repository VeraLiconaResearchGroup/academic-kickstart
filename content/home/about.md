# The Vera-Licona Research Group

Our research is at the intersection of computational systems medicine and systems biology, mathematical biology and bioinformatics. We work on the design, software development and application of mathematical algorithms for the modeling, simulation and control of biological systems. 

In molecular biology the systems of our interest include gene regulatory networks and intracellular signaling networks where we aim to understand the cells' intricate regulatory programs and disregulation in diseases such as cancer. Our ultimate goal is the development of cell reprogramming and control strategies that can translate into novel therapeutics.
